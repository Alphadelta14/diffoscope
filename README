debbindiff
==========

Highlight differences between two builds of Debian packages, and even
other kind of files.

debbindiff will exit with 0 if there's no differences and 1 if there
are. An HTML report can be produced with the detected differences.

debbindiff was written as part of the “reproducible builds” Debian
project: <https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds>
It is meant to be able to quickly understand why two builds of the same
package produce different outputs.

Example
-------

    $ ./debbindiff.py --html output.html build1.changes build2.changes

This will compare `build1.changes` and `build2.changes` and create
`output.html` if there are differences between the two files.

External dependencies
---------------------

The various comparators rely on these external commands being available
in the path:

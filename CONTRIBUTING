=== Contributing code to this project

It's helpful to track fixes or new features via wishlist bugs against the
'diffoscope' package, eg with the 'reportbug' tool ('devscripts' package).

The code is available in the link:https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/diffoscope.git/tree/[diffoscope.git repository].

Patches can be submitted as requests to pull from a publicly-visible
git repository (this is the prefered way) communicated via IRC or mail,
or completly via mail (using git format-patch, see below).
If appropriate, please make a topic branch based on the 'master' branch.

You can send patches or requests to the link:diffoscope@lists.reproducible-builds.org[development list],
or to the tracking bug: <bugnumber>@bugs.debian.org.

One possible workflow:
----
  git clone git://anonscm.debian.org/reproducible/diffoscope.git
  git checkout origin/master -b <topicname>
  # <edits>
  git commit -a
  git format-patch -M origin/master

  reportbug qa.debian.org
  # <describe the issue, attach the patch>
----


=== Uploading the package

When uploading diffoscope to the Debian archive, please take extra care to
make sure the uploaded source package is correct, that is it includes the
files tests/data/test(1|2).(a|o) which in some cases are removed by dpkg-dev
when building the package. See https://bugs.debian.org/834315 for an example
ftbfs bug caused by this and see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=735377#44
and followups to learn how this happened and how to prevent it.

After uploading, please also update the version on PyPI using::

   $ python3 setup.py sdist upload --sign

Once the tracker.debian.org entry appears, consider tweeting the release on
